;;; Commentary:

;; This package is an alternative frontend for `completion-at-point'.
;; It replaces the standard completions buffer with ido prompt.
;; Press <M-tab> or <C-M-i> to complete a symbol at point.

;;; Installation:

;; (require 'ido-at-point) ; unless installed from a package
;; (ido-at-point-mode)

;;; Code:

(require 'ido)
